# reaper-rs

Makes REAPER SDK accessible from Rust.

Consists of 3 layers:

1. Low-level API
    - Copied from bindings generated by `bindgen` from `reaper_plugin_functions.h`
    - Makes access of function pointers safe
    - Not a pleasure to work with because it's still doesn't use Rust types
2. Medium-level API
    - Uses low-level API
    - Exposes the original REAPER SDK functions almost 1:1, so as closely as possible **but** contains 
      some improvements, like being able to deal with Rust strings instead of C-strings
    - Not very opinionated, just some obvious common-sense adjustments probably every Rust programmer
      would do in order to get the API closer to Rust (if you don't think so and want to suggest a
      different form of adjustment for the low-level API, please raise an issue) 
3. High-level API
    - Uses medium-level API
    - In some ways opinionated because it uses tools like rxRust to deal with events
    - In other ways just consequent because it reflects 1:1 the typical hierarchy of a REAPER project
      (Project → Track → Item)   
    - A pleasure to work with (in my opinion)
    - Integration tests use this
    
## Develop

### Build

- `bindgen` should be executed on Linux (including Windows WSL)
